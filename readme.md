After watching [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W-r7ABrMYU) from 2001 titled, "An Evening with Ray Bradbury," I decided to embark on 

In 2001, Ray Bradbury gave a speech at the University of California where he encouraged young writers to read three things every night: 

1. One short story (Dahl, Hemingway, Matheson, Cheever, Kneale, COllier, Warton, Irving)
2. One poem (Shakespeare, Frost, and Pope)
3. One essay (Huxley, Eiseley)

His goal is to make you into a collector of the metaphor -- filling your head with thoughts, theories, and ideas before bed, rather than completing another level in Angry Birds. 

This repository is my goal to 1.) follow Bradbury's advice, and 2.) create a list of reading material to fill 1,000 nights.
